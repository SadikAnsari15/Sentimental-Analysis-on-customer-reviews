I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.Build quality was great as always from Apple.Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I’m happy with the blue colour  “ not bad at all and not too flashy”Grip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient  as a normal user.If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it’s my personal opinion as a long time apple user)As you all know iPhone 12 won’t comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900I don’t judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I’m completely satisfied  with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.Thank you Apple IndiaThank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.Thank you Amazon India.( Note: charger brick was shown in my video was bought myself from Apple India online store because it won’t comes with the phone)\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'review ': '\\n\\n  Extremely disappointed with this phone. It’s a seemingly average phone which is over priced by 4 to 5 times at least. This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple’s trickery and gimmickry.The battery doesn’t last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won’t be enough for anyone.And then there are other apple quirks - won’t come with a SD card, won’t come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won’t work with this one. Face ID won’t work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you’re out and vulnerable. This phone won’t allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn’t use. You won’t be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won’t let you.Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn’t cost you more than 12 to 14K.Apple is going down!Amazon won’t take this phone back as they have a 10 day return policy. So I am pretty much stuck with this damn excuse for a phone till I get to upgrade to a Samsung phone.\\n\\n'},\n",

If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you’re on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.Here’s some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know “How to save battery on iPhone 12” this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don’t have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.Got original product Btw!!!!!\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'review ': '\\n\\n  I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items.  But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'review ': '\\n\\n  After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ₹ 84900. After credit card discount(₹6000), old phone exchange(₹3450) and reward points money(₹4530) inclusion, I bought it for ₹70920. There’s also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn’t let go of blue1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it’d cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn’t seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.2: DISPLAY: I’ve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.How to choose between 64/128gb:If you’re not really tight on budget, I’d suggest to go for 128gb variant. I’ve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage  occupied about 60gb. So it’d make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.CONS:1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price2. If you’re an android user, migration would be little time consumingUpdate: I’ve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)\\n\\n'},\n",

The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I’ll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don’t usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I’ll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don’t play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don’t believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'review ': \"\\n\\n  When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily.\\n\\n\"},\n",

       "  'review ': '\\n\\n  I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I’ve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021),  apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra.  If you read a few reviews you’ll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues  and 9pro cameras didn’t live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand5. The haptics are spot onWhat’s Missing: (Minor misses though)1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you’ll get used to it.2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensorWait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:It took a while for 12’s prices to fall.  If you’re willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.64GB or 128GB:The difference is around ₹6000.  64GB if you don’t play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128😊Battery:I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to  it’s competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.Android Flagship Option:The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.Hope this review helped :)Update:13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That’s it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12’s launch price(86k).  If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still  do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k).  However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'review ': \"\\n\\n  From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.As per the limitations :1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)Advantages:1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)4. The design and in-hand feel.5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.But iPhone 12 in 2020?  its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience.\\n\\n\"},\n",

I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices  because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again.  FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is  real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here\\n\\n'},\n",

Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.And with a future update, facebook won\\'t be able to track what you\\'re doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud. 2. BatteryThe battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can\\'t touch this. If you bring this up with them, they\\'ll distract you by saying it has fast charging.3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.4. Build Quality - SOLID.5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be \"raam bharose\", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won\\'t work. Half baked implementation.Pro Android / Anti - iOS1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year\\'s model can make it better.4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don\\'t think that these don\\'t stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.I\\'ll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they\\'re way too deep in ios ecosystem now.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'review ': \"\\n\\n  First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-1. Notifications- You can't reply through notifications.- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.2. App library- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.3. whatsapp- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing.\\n\\n\"},\n",

Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.And boy was I surprised . Let’s take up the review in sections.1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it’s only for social media and you are not printing really big.3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it’s average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended.\\n\\n'},\n",

Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn’t seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model.\\n\\n'},\n",

My umpteen emails to Amazon customer service on this topic was unanswered and finally upon escalation, the Executive CS team wrote back stating that the reasons for exchange can't be shared as it's an internal communication of theirs. Quite absurd! I quote below the etracts of their email dated 25th Aug 2021... Quote: I've reviewed your concern and see that our customer service team was able to address your issue concerning your exchange being denied. We are unable to provide internal information about the reason for exchanges being denied. Unquote:Now that's a complete surprise to a customer... If my phone doesn't gets exchanged, as customers I need to know the reasons too.. denial by Amazon to give a reason implies here that the exchange options are a gimmick to lure in customers to buy Phones on their online store.. Definitely, never expected Amazon to behave in this manner. Asides, Amazon CS took conveniently more than 2 weeks to respond to my emails and when they have responded the return window too is closed!!! Sad :(\\n\\n\"},\n",

And finally 64gb is good enough if you ask me as most of those having wifi connection can easily upgrade to i cloud paying just 75rs/Month and for the average 3 years of use the price will be still 2700rs in three year. For the 128gb i had to pay 8000rs more so still i am saving around 5300rs if i chose to use i cloud from the starting day.No Finger print sensor , but it's ok the face id does it right but yes the finger print should be good.

Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000₹ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000₹ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000₹. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900₹ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure.\\n\\n\"},\n",

Another issue is the notch which makes the phone look outdated especially in 2021. The Face ID is also not useful while wearing masks which causes a lot of inconvenience since the phone doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner.

But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty.

Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones.

There is a lot available on internet to tell you about what you will lose out on. It is like speaking a new language altogether.Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.Rest, there are tons of reviews to praise the phone and I agree with most of them.Was a bit disappointed the way it was packaged. No foam or bubble wrap.\\n\\n'},\n",

This move to IPhone 12 was a calculative yet bolder definitive move.Let’s look at the some of key pointers here what I saw -- Stunning design and spectacular OLed display pouring out all the vivid colors- Smooth app flow and transitions- Longer battery life 7-8 hrs without automation (best in my usage)-  Camera is just bringing the life out of all the captures you make.*I am using Apple 20w charger which is insane at charging 20-25 percent in 7 mins. So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It’s almost a month of usage and I can boldly say, “The best switch one can make”. I know the price tag is always hefty but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving.\\n\\n'},\n",

Battery health got depleted to 91% and not sure I don’t game or edit things every day. This should be a beast on multitasking but yeah it is what it is. I’m gonna sell this one sometime. Even there are recommendations to use genuine products but it’s kind of overrated. Apple should seriously work on this battery part.\\n\\n'},\n",

And upon contacting customer support I was informed by Ms. Tuleshwari from support team to connect with Brand and in case the brand is ready to issue a service report they will initiate the replacement request. Upon getting the service report done from Apple service centre the support team staff Mr. Sanjay on outright basis denied replacment stating we cant issue basis the report. It's the brand who will have to be contacted. Customer service and support is clearly lacking with a brand like Amazon. What's the point of claiming of a free 7 day replacement policy when the support team clearly twists it as per their own convenience.

Since I am not a fan of too much customization so for me this UI is totally fine. Plus gaming experience was also good till now I played nfs no limit and it works like a champ. I also really like it's ram working since my app in background keeps running without always reloading it when again opened.One last since I haven't used 120 Hz refresh rate so I can’t tell about it but since my old phone was also no having it so for me it's awesome👌.Camera is also awesome till now I haven't used it much due to covid but in low light it worked too good no doubt about it:).Hope this will help someone😁\\n\\n\"},\n",

My review is based on that pricing as I got my father one of those just yesterday and here is what i have noticed.PROS -a) Great build quality, very light phone. After using an 11pro max and a 13pro max this size is so much easier to behold and a lot easier without bells and whistles.b) Good Camera set up - you will get two options, normal and zoom out. Both are clear and perfectly adequate.c) Nice loud speakersd) Oled Display - not the best display but this was apple's foray into a non-pro phone with OLED display and it was a very successful onee) Software - Apple software is great and the processor is speedy.f) Great voice quality and good signal - again somehting to behold and cherish.g) Face ID is supe fasth) Speedy now and speedy after 3 years also.CONS -Some may think this is expensive (but please note after 2 years you will still be able to get half of the value in return. That is something only Apple does well so cost of ownership works out to around 1000 a month)Feels very flimsy and insubstantial without case owing to less weightNo finger print scanner. Apple support is terrible.OPTIONS - If you want to go for an android i recommend the fan edition version of Samsungs, a one plus 9pro or a pixel 4a. The pixel 4a is best value. The one plus is good for photos but video is not even as good as an iPhone 8. Apple has best video in class across the last 3 years.\\n\\n\"},\n",

This is solely based on my 2 months of experience with a defective iPhone12 128GB purchased from Amazon.Part I - The Rise of \\'iPhone\\'The Saga began with an aspiration to buy a quality iPhone, feedback was that it never hangs....but wait no one told me that it won\\'t hang till it works . This came as a gift to me from my wife, seeing my aspiration, she also got inspired and jumped the Gun to buy it on my birthday......But none of us imagined the nightmare it will become if you got yourself a defective piece. Don\\'t believe me, search for \"iPhone 12 non-responsive screen\". You will get heartburns reading how many of them have non-responsive screens and have not worked even after replacement of whole phone itself, one guy had it replaced 3 times but issue kept coming back.It seems iPhone 12 is a defective buildAfter approx 15-20 days I started seeing same issue of phone unlocking(face unlock) but then nothing used to work on the touch screen. You are effectively not able to walk past the unlocked screen.If you locked and unlocked again, touch screen would start functioning till the next time it would behave in the same manner. I installed the apple support app to diagnose the issue and luckily the touchscreen issues went away without any trace.But wait, I wasnt so lucky, the same issue crept back exactly on the 54th day but this time with a vengeance, the phone simply wouldn\\'t unlock no matter what you do. You can see the screen, it would charge and reboot and all that . Now began the nightmare which is the Part II.Part II - The Phantom(iPhone service) menace- No direct way to contact India customer support, only through chat and they will do an automated call back- First they tell me the usual workarounds, press button A, B, C etc etc. which I have already tried, standard procedures eating up so much time- Next after frustrating 30 min call with them, they send me instructions over email to take backup and do a factory restore(ignoring the fact that the touch screen isnt working)- As expected cannot take backup using itunes due to the PIN which requires your touch screen to work, frustrations are on the peak.- Now I reach back to support and they are trying to get me an appointment with the nearest service center, their service locator app is not working and I am scheduled a call back.- I wait at the designated schedule but I get a mail that I am not reachable, wait....my number is pre-fixed with a +91 and the automated call back is also adding another +91......shikes I will never get a call back.- Now I try to reach out to them, with the frustrations at the peak, didn\\'t want to talk to them so started a chat session and luckily got the appointment with them in the next hour.- Reached the Service center, they asked me to wait, diagnosed and found that the iphone screen is not responsive, have to seek guidance from Apple.- After a week of checking online status which didnt change, I called the service center and asked for status. I am told that they are waiting for parts from Apple. I told them I am not interested, either replace the whole handset or refund the money.-I am provided Apple support number to talk to, as it a decision that has to come from Apple.- I immediately call Apple support and have a long conversation of over 45 minutes in which they are defiant to replace the handset and insist that they provide quality repair in India which after repairs will be like new only.- I offer them this \"NEW\" repaired phone and to give me my money back. I also state that in the USA, they replace and in INDIA is a repair, to which I am given an answer that every region has a different policy.....how discriminatory.- The call ends after 45 minutes of strong discussions that I will evaluate the quality of repair and then only accept the phone back. But with still no change in status on their site, I am not sure if they even know what to do with these screen issues on iPhonePart III - The Empire Strikes Back- For many days apple service did not have a clue on whats happening except for waiting for Apple to respond- After multiple followups and posts on twitter, got some attention- Repaired phone(not acceptable) was returned after 13 days with chassis replaced- Poor service for one of \"the\" expensive phones on this planet, Apple has taken Indian customers for granted. I am sure they would have replaced the phone immediately in US.BAD overall experience, has spoiled the product ownership experience forever.\\n\\n'},\n",
