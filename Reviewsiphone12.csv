   Dear Team,Please be informed that I am very dissatisfied by the services provided by Amazon buying this much expensive mobile from Amazon is not worth I believe they always provide us the defected item I recently purchased I phone 12 and it is creating a problem while switching on had to try multiple times for the same and this problem occurs every time whenever I switch off the mobile last time also the same issue occur when I bought my One plus 08 there was issue related to camera image was getting blurred each time and then I have to replace it I think Amazon just sell defected items I am very angry and wil take it forward because it's second time in a row and will never suggest any one to buy mobile especially from Amazon and also want to post the review about this on social media

  Its my First Apple device. Happy to own it after a long confusion between iPhone 11 and 12. I believe, it was worth waiting for 12.Received it on 04-Nov-2020. Working well till now. Checked Service Support Coverage. Its a genuine product.AndiPhone in white color is legend.Update after 1 month approx.-----------------------------------After using it for a month I am in love with this phone. Too smooth and I forgot what is lagging...Battery backup is very good and lasts one and half day easily with normal usage. I charge my phone when the battery is around 30%. Battery health is 100% after a month.Camera is awesome and gives very nicely detailed pictures with true colors.Phone speakers are really great and warm. They are loud but don't shout. Listening music or watching videos are enjoyable without earphones too.4G speed better than other 4g phones I have.Worth every penny.

  I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I’ve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021),  apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra.  If you read a few reviews you’ll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues  and 9pro cameras didn’t live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand5. The haptics are spot onWhat’s Missing: (Minor misses though)1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you’ll get used to it.2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensorWait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:It took a while for 12’s prices to fall.  If you’re willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.64GB or 128GB:The difference is around ₹6000.  64GB if you don’t play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128😊Battery:I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to  it’s competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.Android Flagship Option:The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.Hope this review helped :)Update:13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That’s it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12’s launch price(86k).  If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still  do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k).  However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022.

  Okay I NEED TO CLEAR a few misconceptions about this phone because i am seeing a lot of negative reviews here which are not true, probably from IOS haters. I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices  because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again.  FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is  real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here

  Pros:there are 1000s of blog for prosCons:Apple has to work to improve their battery lifeCharger ! Charger ! Charger ! If apple really cares about environment so much then they must deliver a phone once in 3 years. Or, give the users a usb c.Don’t rely on their screen advertising. Use a cover. Glass is still a glass and you can observe scratches after a month of usage.5g isn’t for India, still price in terms of dollars was same!

  Android v/s iOSPro Apple1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud. 2. BatteryThe battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.4. Build Quality - SOLID.5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.Pro Android / Anti - iOS1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.I'll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they're way too deep in ios ecosystem now.

  Device is wonderful but never buy expensive items from Amazon, its better to purchase from Apple store.Delayed delivery by 3 days and on top of it no one in amazon knows where my device was. I have to perform multiple follow ups to enquire about my device and Amazon CSR is worst when it comes to logging a complaint.The final product received is having a dent and Amazon denied servicing and asked to check with Apple, Apple of-course denied since the product is purchased from third party e-commerce website.Lesson learned after 5 days of total frustration and being played as shuttlecock between Amazon and Apple, its better to spend few bucks more and purchase iPhone from Apple rather than typing this review with a dented device.

10,Ranit Kumar Dholey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is going to be a long review, sit back, relax and have a read.I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.And boy was I surprised . Let’s take up the review in sections.1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it’s only for social media and you are not printing really big.3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it’s average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended.

  Great battery life. Love the white colour. Blue is super hyped. It is a finger print magnet.There’s something about the design of these phones. No android phone can match the aesthetics. Except some curved display screens.Upgraded from iPhone 8. I am very very happy.Wish it was a bit cheaper. Bought with 6k instant hdfc discount and 6 months no cost emi.128gb.

"
12,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn’t seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model.

  My existing iPhone was not exchanged and the reasons too weren't cited. The existing phones were in good condition. I dare Amazon to give me the reasons for not exchanging it if they have one. So don't fall for the exchange pray, appears to be a ploy. My umpteen emails to Amazon customer service on this topic was unanswered and finally upon escalation, the Executive CS team wrote back stating that the reasons for exchange can't be shared as it's an internal communication of theirs. Quite absurd! I quote below the etracts of their email dated 25th Aug 2021... Quote: I've reviewed your concern and see that our customer service team was able to address your issue concerning your exchange being denied. We are unable to provide internal information about the reason for exchanges being denied. Unquote:Now that's a complete surprise to a customer... If my phone doesn't gets exchanged, as customers I need to know the reasons too.. denial by Amazon to give a reason implies here that the exchange options are a gimmick to lure in customers to buy Phones on their online store.. Definitely, never expected Amazon to behave in this manner. Asides, Amazon CS took conveniently more than 2 weeks to respond to my emails and when they have responded the return window too is closed!!! Sad :(

  Worst camera quality, want my money refund but Apple denied to refund and amazon asking to go Apple service center to have deny later from Apple. If you are planning to buy an iphone then please buy from stores only if you want genuine one. I got a defective product from seller. And After paying my hard earned money iphone says thats not their responsibility third class service centers, don't care customers time.

  Buying an iphone was a dream for me . This is my first ios device , The most i liked about this iphone is the inhand feel light weight,compact boxy design helps easy to hold the fone. When i was planned to switch from android to ios most of my frds told that battery life is a minus in iphones, but frankly i tell that the battery life effortlessly lasts for one complete day.Camera, display,sounds are awsome. The main attractive of this device is its permformance, no lag , best optimised software and gaming is simply awesome.

  I received the phone with a crack on its screen which was apparently not visible to a naked eye.But this crack started to increase in size and became more visible after few days when the phone started heating. Now Amazon has taken there hands out of this matter and neither apple is helping me, furthermore they are asking me to get my screen replaced which will cost me ₹26500. So I request everyone to not buy there  phones  from Amazon.

  Likes:ios- efficient and tidy.5G; Jio gives 4G+ currently to 5G mobiles as of 27-Dec-2020.The chassis feels different than rest phones in a good way.OLED display feels good to view.Usual iPhone perks- longer software support.Dislikes:Overpriced as usual, more so this time since not bundled with earphones and charger.Apple charger doesn't come with a lightning cable. Please buy cable separately, if needed.The selfie camera dulls the skin tone. Selfies taken via Androids look better.Here's my 2 cents:I'm using it as a secondary phone with OnePlus 8 as my primary.Please use your discretion.Thanks.

  The phone worked fine for 10 days after that the phone started heating and after that the charging was slow and now its 1month and the phone's speaker is not working .. i have given 84000 for this product to your company and i have called ur support system but they have told me to go to apple service center..I have taken the phone today and they have told me that it will take 7 days to fix it .. but my point is that i want a new phone or i want my money back as i m not 1% satisfied with ur product and customer service so plzz dnt put ur company name down and provide me a new phone if the phone dosent satisfy me after the phone is returned to me by the apple service center . Or else i will go to consumer court .. plzz call me as soon as possible and provide me a proper reply and if i dont get any solution that is good to me then i will file an case in the consumer court .

  I got this phone on 4th May. And something was wrong with this phone. Also my brother bought the same phone but from a store. And that's working perfectly.Also apple gives 14 day return policy on each apple product but they closed my return window in 6 daysI started facing battery issues after few days. Phone was charging from 0-100% in about half an hour and same with the discharge.It went from 100 to 46% in 15 minutes and sometimes sudden shutdowns. I visited service centres and still my issues have not been resolved.I tried amazon support to help me but nothing happened and still the device is not in well condition and I can't use it.I had already checked that my product is genuine by filling all the details at apple website.But something is wrong either from amazon or apple.I can recommend if you are buying this device buy it a from a genuine store.In order to save 2-3k I made a mistake I guess.

  In this mask era, fingerprint is a must and sadly this phone doesn't have it. Being a doctor, I find it very difficult. Since I don't use it much, battery life is 2 days. Face recognition doesn't work with a mask and specs on. Better buy a Redmi which costs ₹9,000 than this one for ₹75,000 just to show off.

  Phone is good and it fits really well in hand. Only problem I have found in iPhone 12 is overheating and this started from the moment I have unboxed it. I have tried to contact Apple and Amazon but no one is agree to help me fix this heating issue or replace it.freezing to death all within 6 months and best part there is no after sales support either by Apple or Amazon.Kind of service I have received from Apple, I think this is my first and last iPhone, second apple product and last.It's better to get it from other platform or get it from store, Amazon does not provide any after sales support for iPhone 12.Overall horrible service from giants organization like, Apple and Amazon.

  Upgraded to brand new iPhone 12 (128gb) last week and from very first moment could feel the phone getting warmer to hotter from rear side and heat travels from back to side bezels making it even unable to hold the phone during FaceTime or work calls. After calling thrice to Apple official support, the staff was disconcerted and blamed it upon ‘normal behaviour’ of phone. However Amazon was kind enough to understand the issue and provided support to me. I recommend Amazon customer service.

  It’s such a disappointment. I have been using iPhone since it’s first version.So naturally upgraded from iPhone X to 12. But the excitement quickly died down as soon as I saw the screen. There is a warm greenish tint to it which makes the colors off.Selfie portraits aren’t good either. Too sharp for portraits. May be I should have gone for the 12 Pro Max as it handles much better because of the telephoto lens.Hope apple fixes the screen issues soon

  The hardware- cameras, spatial audio system, built and chip- are really really good. Better than any other high end phone in the market.The iOS software is really awesome! With features like shortcuts, siri among others- this phone is the smartest smart phone in the market.

  I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000₹ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000₹ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000₹. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900₹ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure.

  I bought this iPhone 12 128 GB after  3 days slowly letter b stoped working on keyboard I thought it was software glitch as sometime updateing software would solve the issue as we are in a pandamic situation I moved to my village where there little reception so update took 2 to 3 days to download. But even after updating there was no improvement so called apple support spoke to then at length about my situation and after hearing me they did some troubleshooting and came to a conclusion that it has some hardware problem and should approach Amazon as they were responsible for selling me this product for replacement.  by this time 7 days completed and according to the Amazon policy they only return and replace for 7 days.  When spoke to Amazon customer care they just wouldn't connect me to the concern department they just bluntly say I should approach apple but apple executive tells me he can't do anything. Is this how you treat a loyal customer you can check my account the and frequency I order trough Amazon. Not even connecting call to the concern department.

35,Amesh Gharat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Overall good phone as it feels very premium, being made with high quality materials and has great performance. Excellent camera quality, great design and screen quality. The A14 processor is super fast and the phone never heats up even while performing intensive tasks. The speakers are very loud and clear and give out high quality sound.One problem I encountered is that  the battery life is not great but definitely above average. Another issue is the notch which makes the phone look outdated especially in 2021. The Face ID is also not useful while wearing masks which causes a lot of inconvenience since the phone doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner. The phone is also limited to a 60Hz refresh rate which again makes it less compelling than the competition which makes phones with 120Hz refresh rate at a much lower price.

  Upgraded from an iPhone 7 32 gigs to iPhone 12 . After holding out for a long time the upgrade was worth it. All the feature set display, camera, speakers, signal reception, chipset is a huge upgrade. Recommended if you happen to have a device from 2016 or older. This device will be the new standard iPhone for the next 4 years. So worth it if you get it now.

  No wonder Apple makes some of the best phones in the world. Iphone 12 deservedly is the highest selling phone.I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase.

  Now it's almost more than 2 weeks of usage and I'm fully satisfied with the performance. Earlier I was using oneplus 6T and after malfunction of the screen, i decided to move to Iphone. Before buying i had done all the R&D. Many of reviews says that it has bad battery life and couldn't stand a day. But as per my usages my battery stays all day long. I used to make call (6 to 7 hours), video, music, surfing everything except game and battery last upto 24 hours with data mode on.In my opinion its worth buying.

  Product delivered on 3 Jan, today is 6th Jan 2022 time 12:08 am. Problem with the product that got delivered to me is it's front camera hangs a lot, there's no newness of the product which made me feel like I have been decived with refurbished phone. ( Though I am not sure but as I said there is no newness also battery backup was real poor, I still remember when I bought one plus 5T it's battery lasted for atleast 2-3 days without any recharging but this product that delivered to me either it is not authentic or I have received defective one. Obviously seller won't return the item so u have to visit store to sort out your problems with phone. I hate it.

  Premium looks, smooth user interface, outstanding camera quality, top class screen, great sound quality from stereo speakers. Instant face detection and unlocking. No finger print sensor (not required as face detection does the job instantly). No 3.5 mm port for headphones, requires airpods or bluetooth headset. Excellent noise cancellation. Double sim (nano+esim). Easy to switch from Android with inbuilt feature to transfer all the data.

  This is the fastest iphone I have seen so far. True Value for money. Compared it with several other phones and observed that iphone12 is significantly faster than all the phones.Phone build quality is excellent. It supports fast charging capability which is very good. Using a 20W USB-C adaptor I am able to charge it from 20% to 100% within 1 hour.Battery life is also good compared to previous iphones.

44,Soyeb Ahmed,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Writing this review after nine months of using. Overall user interface is very good, picture quality is very good, battery life is somewhere average. I have faced discolouration issue in nine months without any fall or anything and apple service centre denied any service for this issue. Being a premium phone, this visual issue shall not occur so easily. Disappointed that such a costly phone doesn’t cover this in warranty and what kind of painting they do that peels off so easily.

  Good product, bringing back the old 5s style advantage.But, Moved from pixel3 to iphone12.I felt pixel is better than iphone 12, only best part of iphone12 is iosExpected more from BatteryCamera is good, build quality is great

46,pritish panda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is my 1st iphone and I loved it. I m not the one who is biased for iphone. But I personally loved it. Camera,Battery, sound everything is perfect. Do not set high expectations from battery, It is like u charged it in morning and use it whole day.Concern-: Data transfer is a big problem. If u want to transfer data to android mobile then watsapp is the only option. Till now I have not found any application yet which will help to transfer data smoothly.

I am ok with the price but wont felt price of this phone gives justifiable to the performance and efficiency of battery.I always fight with my friend related to iphone and android.This time for sure i am going to switch to some other phone like oneplus.
